> [**Senior demon Screwtape**:] Music and silence—how I detest them both! How thankful we should be that ever since our Father entered Hell ... no square inch of infernal space and no moment of infernal time has been surrendered to either of those abominable forces, but all has been occupied by Noise—Noise, the grand dynamism, the audible expression of all that is exultant, ruthless, and virile—Noise which alone defends us from silly qualms, despairing scruples, and impossible desires. We will make the whole universe a noise in the end. We have already made great strides in this direction as regards the Earth. The melodies and silences of Heaven will be shouted down in the end.

## I.

Podcasts are like porn, in that you are simulating intellectual engagement and friendship without participating in them. And just like porn, the effect is a net decrease in the object of voyeurism.

As Applied Divinity Studies puts it, 

> You mistake [the podcasters'] knowledge/understanding for your own, which actually makes you less curious and invest less seriously in learning.

So many podcasts are just an interviewer helping the guest summarize some idea she has written about in greater depth in a book or blog post. If you listen to a lot of podcasts, you get used to this anemic form of communication - where the full context of a theory is not explained and extended arguments are shoved into a couple of sentences. Learning then just becomes about exposure to different ideas - where exposure means being broadly aware that some idea exists without necessarily understanding it. The full implications of a theory and it connections and conflicts with other theories are not explored. You cannot form a coherent worldview with this kind of pathalogical context-switching.

One of the main benefits podcasts could provide is real time debate and exploration of a topic between experts. It's unfortunate how few podcasts take advantage of this possibility. Most of the time, the interviewer will just ask open-ended vacuous questions proding the guest to recount the intro chapter of her new book or confirm that she's ingroup: What is this book about? Why did you write it? That's interesting, can you give me some examples of that? The wokes are really wrong about this, aren't they?

Even when the interviewer has done his prep and his questions aren't just paraphrased chapter titles from the guest's book, he rarely invites the guest to go deep on single subject. And thanks to my podcast, I now understand why this is necessary. When I interviewed David Deutsch, I really wanted to iron out my criticisms of his theory of AI with him. But I noticed that by the time I we had finished discussing three counterarguments (each of which I cut short in order to save time), we were already 40 minutes into what was initially scheduled to be an hour long interview. And AI was just one of the topics I wanted to ask someone as brilliant and multidisciplinary as him about. So we just had to move on. 

Even if you had the time, it's difficult to orally cover empirical or detailed arguments. I often feel a big gulf between the quality and depth of my guest's work on a topic and our discussion of that work. For example, Tyler Cowen did all kinds of detailed analysis in his book *Big Business*. But when I asked him why he's concerned about declining startups in *The Complacent Class* when existing big businesses are so great, he basically answered, I looked into it more. And it's not his fault. What is he supposed to do, pull up some charts from NBER papers in the middle of talking with me? As a result, however, someone in the audience might come away thinking, "Now I know why fewer startups is not that big a deal." But you don't, because the reason was never stated. 

And since prodding a particular premise or implication is difficult in real-time oral communication, what you are left with instead are just mood affiliations. How do you feel about this topic or person? Should their status be increased or decreased? It's no wonder then that podcasts place a tremendous selection pressure on politics, culture war, personalities, and Internet drama. 

## II.

Much more than other mediums, podcasts are filled with an immense amount of banter. Banter is a healthy and necessary - it helps people keep in touch and evade the misery of loneliness. The problem is when this desire for comraderie is fulfilled through parasocial relationships, where you snoop into conversations between people who you can never interact with. Sam Harris, Tim Ferris, and Joe Rogan are not your friends - they don't even know you exist. What's more, I guarantee you that they are not spending a big chunk of their day listening to recordings of people droning on about wokeness or productivity or sense-making.

In that sense, I think the relationship between a listener and a popular podcaster is even more disturbing than the one between a man and a pornstar. You consume the content of a pornstar the way you consume a bowl of ice cream - it takes a few minutes, you enjoy it while it lasts, and you feel guilty afterwards but forget about it quickly. You don't form a personal relationship with pornstars, where you adopt their worldview, care about what they think, get their words stuck in your head like you would a song, and keeps up with the drama and controversy surrounding them.

Podcasters try to fill that space in your head that ought to be reserved for your actual friends, but do so in a way that ought to make you feel hollow. At the same time, they deprive you of the few remaining hours of the day you spend in solitude not engaging with the output of another mind. You listen to podcasts on your morning and evening commute. At work you listen to your boss or colleagues drone on in meetings. Even when you excuse yourself to the bathroom, you scroll Twitter until you stop dribbling. And when you get back home, you watch Netflix and YouTube until you collapse. From wakeup to bedtime, you may spend a cumulative 30 minutes alone with your thoughts - consolidating the things you spent the rest learning about.

These other inputs eat up brain cycles which could otherwise be spent solving problems which are actually important or intersting to you.  As Applied Divinity Studies [points out](https://applieddivinitystudies.com/against-news/), it's not some coincidence that you get your best ideas in the shower. That's just time when your brain doesn't have to sustain the bloatware of podcasts and Twitter and can actually process what's imporant.

Besides, it's worth asking why you have a lifestyle where you have hours of congitive downtime every day which would leave you tremendously bored if not for the opiate-like chatter of strangers. Zoning out for extended periods of time on random prerecorded conversations doesn't seem like time well spent. Get a job that isn't 45 minutes away from you. Start reading a fun fantasy novel series. Go make some friends.

## III.

I forget almost everything I hear in podcasts. People often complain about low recall of thigns you read, and that is true, but it is nowhere near as bad as podcasts. At least I remember the last book I read. I honestly couldn't even tell you the title of the last podcast I listened to. 

Hell, I forget most of what I hear in my own podcast. I remember the books, papers, and blog posts of my guests I read in preparation quite well, because I was actively enganging with them in order to come up with good questions. But I do not remember much of the actual interview with them. You could argue that this is because I ask unmemorable questions. But Ezra Klein has said the same about his podcast. And Tyler Cowen did very poorly when his assistant did a podcast year in review quiz with him. If people can't seem to remember what happened on their own podcasts, what's the hope for their audience?

I think this has to do with the fact that unlike reading, listening is an entirely passive activity, and therefore it does not recruit as much of your nueral artillery. At least a real conversation requires engagement in the form of reciprocating dialogue and appropriate body language. But podcasts just require you to be in the same room as the sound. So it becomes really easy to tune out much of what you listen to, and for the rest to wiped when information you barely registered is wiped from short term memory.

However, the main advantage of reading over listening is not the attention which you devote to the content - rather, it is the attention which the creator bestows upon his production. A 2,000 word essay might have required a week of research, thinking, writing, and editiing. The author has thought carefully about how to explain an clearly and efficiently. A thousand word podcast clip is just a 10 minute rant on some random topic that occured to the guest who is way too tried two hours into the conversation to coherenly structure his points.

There's so much content out there anyways. Of the small fraction which you wil ever get to consume. why would you choose to access it via extemperanous chit chat? You can spend the next week reading a book that consolidates years of dilligent inquiry and reflection. Or you can listen to some culture war celebrity ramble on about the travesty of the week. And in the best case you may get to listen to a history or science popularizer give the sort of shallow vacous explanation which people could still listen to while driving in traffic.

## IV.

I'm not condemning all podcasts. Some are actually amazing - taking advantage of the strengths of their medium while avoiding its characteristic defects. I want to point out some notable mentions and figure out what they're doing right

### Hardcore History

The problem with audiobooks is that they sound incredibly stitled - no one speaks the way prose is written. Instead, verbal communication is full of clarifying repitition, emotion, interjections, and tone which is our brain is preprogrammed to extract information from. When mentalese is translated into the written word, this infomration is lost.

But on the Hardcore History podcast, when Dan Carlin speaks, it sounds like speech. A ten minute segment from the show feels like it could be an excerpt from an actual conversation he was having with someone interested in a topic. Except unlike the sorts of convesrations that fill most podcasts, Dan Carlin spends months preparing what he's going to say, reading dozens of books of the topic and planning with great detail exactly what points he's going to make.

I think there's a tremendous opportunity to build a Hardcore Biology or a Hardcore Economics. Someone familiar with the field and gifted at exemperanous elaboration could spend a few weeks organizing a general script, and then just speak. You could actually convey as much information as a book, but do it in the form that humans are endowed to recieve - natural human speech.

### Conversations with Tyler

The secret to Tyler Cowen's podcast is just that he knows a lot of shit. Tyler is familiar with all the fields the guest in an expert in, and then some. Therefore, he is aware of hundreds of connections between the guest's work other interesting topics. He can take advantage of this knowledge to ask creative insightful questions that simply would not have occured to anyone else.

## V.

Why aren't there more podcasts like Hardcore History or Conversations with Tyler? I think it's because these podcasts require tons of work. As I said, each Hardcore History episodes requires months of research and planning. And in a sense, Tyler has been prepping for his podcast ever since he was a infovore teenager.

Even though my podcast is nowhere near the quality of these two, let me give you some sense of the work that my best episodes take. If my guest has written 3 books (or the equivalent in blog posts/ papers), that's about 25 hours of reading (I actually have to read if I don't want to ask stupid embarrasing questions - I can't do any bullshit speed reading). Then there's about 4 hours of listening to their interviews on other podcasts so I don't repeat any questions. Another 2 hours to read commentary, rebuttals, and reviews of the guest's books and other work. Plus 2 hours to consolidate my notes and questions. If I write a blog post about their ideas in order to further prepare, then that's another 5 hours. Another 2 to actually shoot the interview and a final 4 to edit and publish it. 

So that's basically a full week worth of work for a single episode. Unless podcasting is your actual job, or you can do prep as a side effect of your day job (you're a student or a researcher), you simply don't have enough time to make a good podcast.

I don't know where exactly this leaves me and my podcast. At my market rate, that's about 4,000 dollars worth of labor to produce a single episode. But then again, if I get 2,000 views across different platforms, then I only need to be generating 2 dollars worth of value per viewer for it to be worth it. Plus, I enjoy the prep. If I wouldn't have read my guests' books anyways, I wouldn't have invited them on. This is not even to mention all the cool people I've met as a result of creating this podcast!









If you listen to Joe Rogan and Lex Friedman while you drive and workout, you may feel the itch to shoot the shit scratched the time your friends invite you to dinner. It's weird and probably unhealthy to have your need for socialization and bonding fulfilled by people who don't even know you exist.

- If there's something you want to understand, then you ought to consume it in the written form - where the author has spent months optimizing the throughput, organization, and clarity of his ideas. 

-  I think that if I read the transcript of the last podcast I heard, I would embarrassed by the sheer vacuousness, repetition [fix], and banality of what I spent my time listening to. I'm struck by how often these podcast episodes are so uninteresting that if the conversation were actually taking place in front of me, I would feel exhausted by the social obligation of pretending to be engaged.

## The cost of podcasts





I'm struck by how often the podcast I'm listening to is so uninteresting that if the conversation were actually taking place in front of me, I would feel exhausted by the social obligation of pretending to be engaged, and I would figure out some way to leave the room. But this raises the question - why do I have so many hours of my day f
