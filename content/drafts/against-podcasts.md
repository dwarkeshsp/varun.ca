> [**Senior demon Screwtape**:] Music and silence—how I detest them both! How thankful we should be that ever since our Father entered Hell ... no square inch of infernal space and no moment of infernal time has been surrendered to either of those abominable forces, but all has been occupied by Noise—Noise, the grand dynamism, the audible expression of all that is exultant, ruthless, and virile—Noise which alone defends us from silly qualms, despairing scruples, and impossible desires. We will make the whole universe a noise in the end. We have already made great strides in this direction as regards the Earth. The melodies and silences of Heaven will be shouted down in the end.

Podcasts are like porn, in that you are simulating intellectual engagement and friendship without participating in them. And just like porn, the effect is a net decrease in the object of voyeurism.

As Applied Divinity Studies puts it, 

> You mistake their knowledge/understanding for your own, which actually makes you less curious and invest less seriously in learning.

Much more than other mediums, podcasts are filled with an immense amount of banter. Banter is a healthy and common form of human interaction - it helps people keep in touch, solidify their relationship, and evade the misery of loniliness. The problem is when this need is fulfilled through parasocial relationships, where you snoop into conversations between people who don't even know you exist.

One of the main benefits podcasts could bring is allow for real time debate or exploration of different topics. It's unfortunate how few podcasts take advantage of this possibility. Most of the time, the interviewer will just ask open-ended vacuous questions basically proding the guest to summarize her new book or confirm that she's ingroup. What is this book about? Why did you write it? That's interesting, can you give me some examples of that? The wokes are really wrong about this, aren't they?

Even when the interviewer has done his prep and his questions aren't just paraphrased chapter titles from the guest's book, he rarely invites the guest to go super deep on single subject. And thanks to my podcast, I now understand why this is necessary. When I interviewed David Deutsch, I really wanted to iron out my criticisms of his theory of AI with him. But I noticed that by the time I we had finished discussing three counterarguments (each of which I cut short in order to save time), we were already 40 minutes into what was initially scheduled to be an hour long interview. And AI was just one of the topics I wanted to query to a mind as brilliant as his about. So we just had to move on. 

And even if you had the time, it's pretty difficult to orally cover empirical or detailed arguments. I often feel a big gulf between the quality and depth of my guest's work on a topic and our discussion of that work. For example, Tyler Cowen did all kinds of industry wide analyses in his book Big Business. But when I asked him why he's concerned about declining startups in The Complacent Class when existing big businesses are so great, he basically answered, I looked into it more. And it's not his fault. For one, my question was kind of vague. Second, what is he supposed to do, pull up some charts from NBER papers in the middle of talking with me? I, or someone in the audience, might come away thinking, "Now I know why fewer startups is not that big a deal." But you don't, because the reason was never stated. 

And since prodding a particular premise or implication is difficult through in oral medium, what you are left with instead are just mood affiliations. How do you feel about this topic or person? Should their status be increased or decreased? It's no wonder then that podcasts place a tremendous selection pressure on politics, culture war, personalities, and drama. 

There's also the fact that I forget almost everyhting I hear in podcasts. People often complain about low recall of thigns you read, and that is true, but it is nowhere near as bad as podcasts. At least I remember the last book I read. I honestly couldn't tell you the title of the last podcast I listened to. 

Hell, I forget most of what I hear in my own podcast. I remember the books, papers, and blog posts of my guests I read in preparation quite well, because I was actively enganging with them in order to form good questions. But I do not remember much of the actual interview with them. You could argue that this is because I ask unmemorable questions. But Ezra Klein has said the same about his podcast. And Tyler did very poorly when his assistant did a podcast year in review quiz with him. If we can't seem to remember what happened on our own podcasts, what's the hope for the audience? [cut last part]

I think this has to do with the fact that unlike reading, listening is an entirely passive activity, and therefore it does not recruit as much of your nueral infantry. At least a real conversation requires engagement in the form of reciprocating dialogue and appropriate body language. But podcasts just require you to be in the same room as the sound. So it becomes really easy to tune out much of what you listen to, and for the rest to wiped when information you barely registered is wiped from short term memory.

But the main advantage of reading over listening is not the attention which you devote to the content - rather, it is the attention which the creator bestows upon his creation. A 2,000 word essay might have required a week of research, thinking, writing, and editiing. A thousand word podcast clip is just a 10 minute rant on some random topic that occured to the guest or a particularly lengthy introduction. 

There's so much content out there anyways. Why would you choose to access the small fraction which you wil ever get to consume via extemperanous chit chat? You can spend the next week reading a book that consolidates years of dilligent inquiry and reflection. Or you can listen to some culture war celebrity ramble on aoubt some new travesy by one side or the other, or science and historyy popularizers give the kind of vacuous shallow explanations which someone could absorb while dribing a car or doing the dishes.

Podcasts deprive you of the few remaining hours of the day you spend in solitude not engaging with the output of another mind. You listen to podcasts on your morning and evening commute. At work you listen to your boss or colleagues drone on during meetings. Even when you excuse yourself to the bathroom, you scroll Twitter until you stop dribbling. And when you get back home, you watch Netflix and YouTube until you collapse. From wakeup to bedtime, you may spend a cumulative 30 minutes alone with your thoughts. Cal Newport points out in *Digital Minimalism* that as late as the 1990s, the technology just did not exist for a person to be able to go a whole day completely submerged in the thoughts of others. 

These other inputs eat up brain cycles which could otherwise be spent solving problems which are actually important or intersting to you. 

As Applied Divinity Studies points out[link], it's not some coincidence that you get your best ideas in the shower. That's just time when your brain doesn't have to sustain the bloatware of podcasts and Twitter and can actually process what's imporant.

Ben Kuhn points o [ginish]

“50%+ focus” is roughly when something becomes the top idea in your mind. It’s when you start caring enough to think about it in the shower. It’s when you start habitually asking “how could this go faster?” It’s when you get relentlessly resourceful. It’s around when you start annoying your coworkers and/or significant other, although that part is avoidable with practice.

Most importantly, you can only be 50%+-focused on one thing at a time—or zero, in bad cases. That makes it critical to conserve your attention, so that you can spend it on what matters.

[move] Besides, maybe it's worth asking why you have a lifestyle where you have hours of congitive down time during day which would leave you tremendously bored if not for the opiate like chatter of strangers. Maybe you should hang out more with your friends, shorten your commute, or find more engaging work.

I'm not condemning all podcasts. Some are actually amazing - taking advantage of the strengths of their medium while avoiding its characteristic defects. Among th







If you listen to Joe Rogan and Lex Friedman while you drive and workout, you may feel the itch to shoot the shit scratched the time your friends invite you to dinner. It's weird and probably unhealthy to have your need for socialization and bonding fulfilled by people who don't even know you exist.

-  I think that if I read the transcript of the last podcast I heard, I would embarrassed by the sheer vacuousness, repetition [fix], and banality of what I spent my time listening to. I'm struck by how often these podcast episodes are so uninteresting that if the conversation were actually taking place in front of me, I would feel exhausted by the social obligation of pretending to be engaged. 

- If you find yourself having hours of cognitive deadtime a day where there is nothing for you to work on or read and no one to talk to, maybe you ought to reconsider your lifestyle. Get a job that isn't 45 minutes away from you. Start a fun fantasy novel series. Go make some friends.

  



## The cost of podcasts



Sam Harris, Tim Ferris, and Joe Rogan are not your friends - they don't even know you exist. What's more, I guarantee you that they are not spending a big chunk of their day listening to recording of people droning on about wokeness or productivity or  

I'm struck by how often the podcast I'm listening to is so uninteresting that if the conversation were actually taking place in front of me, I would feel exhausted by the social obligation of pretending to be engaged, and I would figure out some way to leave the room. But this raises the question - why do I have so many hours of my day f
