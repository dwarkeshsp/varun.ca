> [**Senior demon Screwtape**:] Music and silence—how I detest them both! How thankful we should be that ever since our Father entered Hell ... no square inch of infernal space and no moment of infernal time has been surrendered to either of those abominable forces, but all has been occupied by Noise—Noise, the grand dynamism, the audible expression of all that is exultant, ruthless, and virile—Noise which alone defends us from silly qualms, despairing scruples, and impossible desires. We will make the whole universe a noise in the end. We have already made great strides in this direction as regards the Earth. The melodies and silences of Heaven will be shouted down in the end.

Here is why you should not listen to podcasts:

- Podcasts are like porn, in that you are simulating intellectual engagement and friendship without participating in it. And just like porn, the effect is a net decrease in the object of voyeurism. 

  If you listen to Joe Rogan and Lex Friedman while you drive and workout, you may feel the itch to shoot the shit scratched the time your friends invite you to dinner. It's weird and probably unhealthy to have your need for socialization and bonding fulfilled by people who don't even know you exist. 

- Podcasts deprive you of the few remaining hours of the day you spend in solitude not engaging with the output of another mind. You listen to podcasts on your morning and evening commute. At work you listen to your boss or colleagues drone on during meetings. Even when you excuse yourself to the bathroom, you scroll Twitter until you stop dribbling. And when you get back home, you watch Netflix until you collapse. From wakeup to bedtime, you may spend a cumulative 30 minutes alone with your thoughts. Cal Newport points out in *Digital Minimalism* that as late as the 1990s, the technology did not exist for a normal person to go a whole day completely submerged in the thoughts of others.

- If there's something you want to understand, then you ought to consume it in the written form - where the author has spent months optimizing the throughput, organization, and clarity of his ideas. 

-  I think that if I read the transcript of the last podcast I heard, I would embarrassed by the sheer vacuousness, repetition [fix], and banality of what I spent my time listening to. I'm struck by how often these podcast episodes are so uninteresting that if the conversation were actually taking place in front of me, I would feel exhausted by the social obligation of pretending to be engaged. 

- If you find yourself having hours of cognitive deadtime a day where there is nothing for you to work on or read and no one to talk to, maybe you ought to reconsider your lifestyle. Get a job that isn't 45 minutes away from you. Start a fun fantasy novel series. Go make some friends.

  



## The cost of podcasts



Sam Harris, Tim Ferris, and Joe Rogan are not your friends - they don't even know you exist. What's more, I guarantee you that they are not spending a big chunk of their day listening to recording of people droning on about wokeness or productivity or  

I'm struck by how often the podcast I'm listening to is so uninteresting that if the conversation were actually taking place in front of me, I would feel exhausted by the social obligation of pretending to be engaged, and I would figure out some way to leave the room. But this raises the question - why do I have so many hours of my day f

If you feel that actually have a job or a lifestyle where you can plug in a monologue
