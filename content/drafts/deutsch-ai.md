David Deutsch isn't worried about AI. He thinks AIs will not be fundamentally more powerful than humans:

> The astrophysicist Martin Rees has speculated that somewhere in the universe ‘there could be life and intelligence out there in forms we can’t conceive. Just as a chimpanzee can’t understand quantum theory, it could be there are aspects of reality that are beyond the capacity of our brains.’ But that cannot be so. For if the ‘capacity’ in question is mere computational speed and amount of memory, then we can understand the aspects in question with the help of computers – just as we have understood the world for centuries with the help of pencil and paper. As Einstein remarked, ‘My pencil and I are more clever than I.’ In terms of computational repertoire, our computers – and brains – are already universal (see Chapter 6). But if the claim is that we may be qualitatively unable to understand what some other forms of intelligence can – if our disability cannot be remedied by mere automation – then this is just another claim that the world is not explicable. Indeed, it is tantamount to an appeal to the supernatural, with all the arbitrariness that is inherent in such appeals, for if we wanted to incorporate into our world view an imaginary realm explicable only to superhumans, we need never have bothered to abandon the myths of Persephone and her fellow deities.

His argument is very interesting, but I don't think it make much sense once we break it apart and consider its implications.

## Computational universality does not imply creative universality

If you're not familiar with Deutsch's ideas, then you may not be familiar with how much work he is having words like people, creativity, and explanations do.

[define terms]

[Computational universality](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Turing_completeness) implies that any program which can run on one general-purpose computer can be run on any other general-purpose computer. Since the human brain is a computer, whatever program can run on the hardware than an AI uses (be it a theory of quantum gravity or the recipe for a von Nuemman probe) can be run on a human brain.

But wait, even ants are Turing complete, as is the microcontroller in your fridge and Conway’s Game of Life. But we don’t expect your fridge to emit new symphonies from its air ducts or the cells in the Game of Life to spell out the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem. Why couldn’t we be similarly limited in comparison to superhuman AIs despite having a universal computer in our skulls?

Deutsch argues that this is because humans are universal explainers. We have creativity - the ability to create explanations. This capacity does not exist in increments, you either have it or you don’t. In his view, to suggest that there are some things which we can’t ever understand without some actual explanation for why that is - without even identifying what precisely it is that we can’t understand - is as arbitrary as believing in a God who has placed limits on what we can know.

### Evidence this theory cannot explain

Before I break down whether this explanation  is logically coherent, I just want to bring us back down to Earth and list some basic observations which this theory cannot easily explain:

#### Some humans are stupid

It's pretty clear that not even every human is as intelligent (or creative or whatever word you want to use) as the smartest humans.

David Deutsch is the founder of quantum computing - he proved that you can create a [universal quantum computer](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspa.1985.0070?casa_token=lRNhEmrPdn8AAAAA:jv6qLsZU-KlAPSs8pOCXRuY-gSF4M8AuLr_rvVrX3oJglhL6TAmfC0NsLMufwui-cgu2D0obOJ4ArYI), and he designed a [quantum algorithm](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspa.1992.0167?casa_token=KZ04KPkMH1oAAAAA:Dvf8CRLFxqb4IwcA2RV5lqe0zp5PoaU6rO6vXNKc5hoLN6pN4uElj_wmx7n8_GnTtYlwzvpFIaMoW7s) which solves a certain problem exponentially faster than any classical algorithm. 

Do you think every human being could have done that? Do you think every human being could even understand what he did? And if every human can't even understand the things that the smartest humans can, why would every human (or any human) be able to match the cognitive capacity of future AIs?

In computational terms, maybe he thinks that their brains are like the i3 chip in comparison to Deutsch's i9, or maybe they have less RAM. But at the level of software, their minds could create whatever explanations Deutsch can create if placed on a powerful enough computer. Maybe their brain just doesn't have enough speed or memory for quantum computing, just as a computer from the 90s isn't powerful enough to run modern programs. Okay, so let's give the village idiot a thousand years and an infinite quantity of paper plus whatever resources Deutsch had when he developed the theory of quantum computers. Are you now confident that if he chose to, he could eventually recreate Deutsch's result?



Deutsch's response here seems like a non-sequitur. Just because culture can limit what ideas a person can have doesn't mean that culture is the only thing which can place such limits or that culture can explain all of the cognitive disparities between different people.

If culture is the basis for differences in apparent intelligence between people, Deutsch must explain why twins seperated at birth and adopted by different families (with different cultures) end up having highly correlated levels of intelligence - measurements

> the experiment cannot detect how much of it one can alter without genetic engineering, just by knowing how. That is because the way in which those genes affect happiness may itself depend on knowledge. For instance, a cultural change may affect what people deem to be ‘good looks’, and that would then change whether people tend to be made happier by virtue of having particular genes. Nothing in the study can detect whether such a change is about to happen. Similarly, it cannot detect whether a book will be written one day which will persuade some proportion of the population that all evils are due to lack of knowledge, and that knowledge is created by seeking good explanations. If some of those people consequently create more knowledge than they otherwise would have, and become happier than they otherwise would have been, then part of the 50 per cent of happiness that was ‘genetically determined’ in all previous studies will no longer be so.

Except in the case of the heritability of IQ, we do an explanation: general cofintive ability differs between people

Deutsch has to explain, what is this thing which is

1. So closely correlated with general cognitive ability without being general intelligence itself,
2. Obvious enough to adoptive parents, teachers, and other members of society that they can use it as a basis for discrimination,
3. Yet at the same time so concealed that researchers    

Furthermore, he has to explain why society uses this X factor as a basis of discrimination, why we can't detect this discrimination despite it being so pervasive and intense that it is leading to l

What seems like a better, more parsimonious explanation to you? That 

### Some AIs are smart

### Animals are partly creative

[vyrne quote]

You will find my objections to the idea 

### Differences between computers matter a lot

## AI safety is not slavery

To the extent that he is worried about AI, he is worried about the righteous slave revolt which will result from imprisoning or cognitively impairing artificial people (a.k.a AI safety):

> in regard to AGIs, like any other entities with creativity, we have to forget almost all existing connotations of the word ‘programming’. To treat AGIs like any other computer programs would constitute brainwashing, slavery, and tyranny. And cruelty to children, too, for ‘programming’ an already-running AGI, unlike all other programming, constitutes *education*. And it constitutes *debate*, moral as well as factual. To ignore the rights and personhood of AGIs would not only be the epitome of evil, but also a recipe for disaster: creative beings cannot be enslaved forever.
