After several flirtations, programming finally clicked for me with the introduction to Processing in design school. It was familiar. Similar to Illustrator in the sense that I could draw circles, ellipses and paths. However, I could also describe objects — their innate behaviour, how they interact with others (including the user) and their lifecycle. Press play and watch the system come alive. Computational Design feels like a similar leap. It's like going from Illustrator to Processing. Computational UI Design is moving from tools like Sketch & Figma to…well, that's what I'm here to explore.
